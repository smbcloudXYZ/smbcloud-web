<p>
  <u>We love open source.</u>
</p>

Open source is more than just a licenseâ€”it's a philosophy and a community. At smbCloud, we believe in the power of collaboration, transparency, and shared knowledge. 

<p>
  <u>We build with open source.</u>
</p>

Every part of our platform is built using open source technologies. From the frameworks that power our frontend and backend, to the tools that automate our workflows, open source is the foundation of our work. We stand on the shoulders of countless contributors from around the world.

<p>
  <u>We give back to the open source community.</u>
</p>

We are committed to supporting open source in every way we can. We contribute code, report issues, sponsor projects, and share our own tools and libraries with the world. Our CLI, libraries, and documentation are all open source and available for anyone to use, modify, and improve.
