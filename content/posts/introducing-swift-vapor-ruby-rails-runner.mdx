## Expanding Horizons: Swift (Vapor) and Ruby (Rails) Runners

We're thrilled to announce that our platform now supports **Swift** (with [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/)) and **Ruby** (with [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)) runners! This update opens up new possibilities for developers who want to build, test, and deploy modern web applications using two of the most beloved frameworks in their respective ecosystems.

### Why Swift with Vapor?

- **Modern, Safe, and Fast**: Swift is renowned for its safety and performance. With Vapor, you get a powerful, expressive web framework that brings Swift to the server.

- **Seamless Integration**: Our runner provides a ready-to-use environment for Swift and Vapor projects—no manual setup required.

### Why Ruby with Rails?

- **Convention Over Configuration**: Rails is famous for its productivity and developer happiness, letting you focus on building features instead of boilerplate.
- **Battle-Tested**: Rails powers some of the world’s most popular web applications, with a mature ecosystem and vibrant community.
- **Instant Start**: Spin up Rails apps in seconds with our runner, perfect for prototyping, learning, or production deployments.

### Key Features

- **Zero-Config Runners**: Start coding in Swift (Vapor) or Ruby (Rails) instantly—no environment setup needed.
- **Fast Feedback**: Experience rapid code execution and output, ideal for learning, prototyping, or collaborative development.
- **Consistent Environments**: Each runner is preconfigured for best practices, ensuring your code runs the same everywhere.
