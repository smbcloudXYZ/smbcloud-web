## Meet MoVibe

We're excited to introduce **MoVibe**—a mobile-first git client, deployment app, and code editor by smbCloud. While our CLI deployment tool is powerful, MoVibe offers a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. And you can carry it with you wherever you go. It's built mobile-first, leveraging Rust for speed, reliability, and safety.

### Why MoVibe?

- **Mobile-First**: MoVibe is built from the ground up for mobile devices, making it easy to code, collaborate, and deploy from anywhere.
- **Rust-Based**: Leveraging Rust ensures MoVibe is fast, reliable, and safe—no compromises on performance or correctness.
- **Vibecoding (wip)**: Talk to your codebase in real-time, collaborate seamlessly, and enjoy a UI optimized for touch and gesture.

### Join our beta testing program

Help us shape the future of MoVibe by joining our beta testing program. Your feedback is invaluable as we refine and improve the app.
